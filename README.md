SimpleTV.bundle
===============

This is a Plex Media Server channel plugin for Simple.TV DVRs which lets you
browse and watch your Simple.TV library of recorded shows with Plex.  It
supports multiple DVRs, both local and remote.


Usage
-----

The first time you run the channel, you will need to open the channel settings
and enter your Simple.TV username and password.


Notes
-----

The plugin is configured to cache the list of DVRs for one hour, and everything
else for 5 minutes, so changes to your library (deletions, new recordings, etc)
will take that long to show up in Plex.
